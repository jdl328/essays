### The Applicant Data Card: A Brief History

This exhibition focuses on a mundane, if not obsolete technology: *the United States' Employment Service's (USES) job applicant data card.*

The data card was the essential information technology of the USES, an agency  created in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to provide job-matching services for unemployed Americans during the Great Depression (1929–1939).

The USES set up employment offices in cities around the country, which served as regional labor exchanges for local job seekers. USES employment counselors intended for the data card to serve as “word picture” of the applicant. It was intended to provide a potential employer with all the relevant information they might need about job candidates.

To the right is a data card describing one John P. Morrris. Below are cards that were produced during the same period, describing John C. Travis and Peter Gorski *What year were these cards produced?* *What kinds of information do the cards contain about the workers they describe?*  *Why might this information have been necessary during this period

##  Coding the worker

How exactly did the USES turn workers into data? Typically job seekers would visit their local USES office and say that they were looking for work. An employment counselor would interview them. The goal of the interview was to collect key information about their work history, skills, and other relevant experiences. This information would be recorded on the data card. Training guide for employment counselors emphasized that the data card should serve as a “word picture” of the applicant. It was intended to provide a potential employer with all the relevant information they might need to know about the individual applying for the job.

The kinds of information included on these cards, and which job applicants were asked to provided to counselors, changed over time as new technological systems, institutional imperatives, and sciences of work took hold within the USES. One of the most important changes that occurred within the USES was the adoption of computers to record and store data and to automate the work of matching applicants to jobs.

##  Data and Difference

The data card was also central to the USES efforts to mitigate discrimination on the labor market, particulary against Black Americans and women. As Black Americans and other marginalized groups organized movements against racial discrimination within American society, the affordances particular to emerging information technologies offered USES officials a vision of racial equality achieved through computational methods. For the bureaucrats charged with overseeing government employment programs, computerized job-matching promised to transform how the state identified American citizens and found employment to them. Per this vision, computers would serve as disinterested decision-makers, processing and acting on citizens’ personal data in a manner lacking subjective interpretation or racial bias, in stark contrast to human bureaucrats. The appeal of computing’s “mechanical objectivity” led government officials to plan computerized matching systems across the federal employment service. However, as the development of these systems did not always align with the visions of unbiased and objective technological governance.
