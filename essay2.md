This exhibition focuses on a mundane, if not obsolete technology: *the United States' Employment Service's (USES) job applicant data card.*


The data card was the essential information technology of the USES, an agency  created in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to provide job-matching services for unemployed Americans during the Great Depression (1929–1939).

The USES set up employment offices in cities around the country, which served as regional labor exchanges for local job seekers. USES employment counselors intended for the data card to serve as “word picture” of the applicant. It was intended to provide a potential employer with all the relevant information they might need about job candidates.

To the right is a data card describing one John P. Morrris. *What kinds of information does the card contain about Morris?*

### Turning Workers to Data

How exactly did the USES turn workers into data? Typically job seekers would visit their local USES office and say that they are looking for work. An employment counselor would interview them. The goal of the interview was to collect key information about their work history, skills, and other relevant experiences. This information would be recorded on the data card.
